## Locked group

Locking a group will disable all drop events for this group ensuring no additional panels can be added to the group through drop events.
You can still add groups to a locked panel programatically using the API though.

```tsx
panel.group.locked = true;

// Or

panel.group.locked = 'no-drop-target';
```

Use `true` to keep drop zones top, right, bottom, left for the group. Use `no-drop-target` to disable all drop zones. For you to get a
better understanding of what this means, try and drag the panels in the example below to the locked groups.

<CodeRunner id="dockview/locked"/>
