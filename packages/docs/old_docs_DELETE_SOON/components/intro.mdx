## Introduction

Dockview is an abstraction built on top of [Gridviews](./gridview) where each view is a container of many tabbed panels.

<CodeRunner id="dockview/basic"/>

<br />

> You can access the panels associated group through the `panel.group` variable.
> The group will always be defined and will change if a panel is moved into another group.


## Dockview API

The Dockview API is exposed both at the `onReady` event and on each panel through `props.containerApi`.
Through this API you can control general features of the component and access all added panels.

```tsx title="Dockview API via Panel component"
const MyComponent = (props: IDockviewPanelProps<{ title: string }>) => {
    // props.containerApi...

    return <div>{`My first panel has the title: ${props.params.title}`}</div>;
};
```

```tsx title="Dockview API via the onReady callback"
const onReady = (event: DockviewReadyEvent) => {
    // event.api...
};
```

## Dockview Panel API

```tsx
const MyComponent = (props: IDockviewPanelProps<{ title: string }>) => {
    // props.api...

    return <div>{`My first panel has the title: ${props.params.title}`}</div>;
};
```
