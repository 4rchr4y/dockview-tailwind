# Release Notes

Please reference docs @ [dockview.dev](https://dockview.dev).

## ðŸ›  Miscs

-   Adjust `React` imports [#556](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/556)

    -   Rename `import * as React from 'react'` to `import React from 'react'`
    -   Rename `import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom'` to `import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'`
    -   This is preperation work for supporting multiple framworks (Vue, Angular etc...)

-   Only export CSS from `dockview-core` [#553](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/553)
    -   All required CSS is now found in `dockview-core` only. `dockview` (React) specific CSS has been removed and made compatible with CSS in `dockview-core`. This is preperation work for supporting multiple framworks (Vue, Angular etc...)
    -   For compatibility reasons `dockview-core` CSS continues to be re-exported through `dockview`.
    -   Class name changes as follows:
        -   `tab-action` to `dv-default-tab-action`
        -   `default-tab` to `dv-default-tab`
        -   `tab-content` to `dv-default-tab-content`
        -   `dockview-react-tab` to `dv-default-tab`
        -   `dockview-react-tab-title` to `dv-default-tab-content`
        -   `dv-react-tab-close-btn` to `dv-default-tab-action`
