# Release Notes

Please reference to docs @ [dockview.dev](https://dockview.dev).
If you feel anything is missing or unclear please let me know.

## ðŸš€ Features

-   The `title` parameter for dockview panels has been made optional [#197](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/197).
-   Simplify dockview `toJSON()` format. `1.7.0` will continue to load legacy formats successfully. [#199](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/199).
-   Examples found @ [dockview.dev](https://dockview.dev) now all link to CodeSandboxes where you can try them out for yourself and view the underlying code.
-   Fix dockview group api `setContaints` method to work as expected. [#212](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/212).
-   Fix dnd events for third-party dnd controls within dockview panels [#126](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/216).

## ðŸ›  Miscs

-   Split `dockview` into two packages, `dockview-core` containing the core logic and `dockview` containing the react wrapper. [#174](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/174) [#199](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/199).
    -   `dockview` depends on `dockview-core` so no installation changes are required, you still only need to install `dockview`.
    -   This is work in progress for supporting a vanilla JS version of dockview. At this time `dockview-core` is not designed to be used directly.

## ðŸ”¥ Breaking changes

-   Remove `setConstraints` from the dockview panel api. [#212](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/212).
